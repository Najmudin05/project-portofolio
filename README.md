## Project 1 : Movie Analysis
### [About Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages. This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

### *Summary:*
1. More than 50% of the data consists of movies with a rating above 3.
2. The average movie duration is around 94 minutes.
3. Movies with good ratings mostly have durations between 90â€“120 minutes.
4. Only 10% of all movies make a profit.
5. Movies with good ratings do not necessarily generate large profits.
6. Movies with a rating below 3 have profits below 1 billion.

## Project 2 : User Retention Analysis 

### *Summary:*
1. In January 2010, there were 713 users who made their first transaction, making it the largest cohort. This cohort also had the highest retention rate in the second month (39%), indicating a good level of continuity.
2. Additionally, this cohort remained loyal, with a retention rate of around 40% or more for the following months. However, it should be noted that the majority of users across various cohorts did not return to transact, with retention rates not reaching 50%.
3. Of particular concern is the lowest retention rate observed in December 2010, highlighting end-of-year challenges in retaining users.

## Project 3 : User Segmentation Analysis

### *Summary:*
1. From user data, it appears that the segments with the largest number of users are Hibernating (27.3%), Champions (14.1%), and Loyal Customers (14.0%).
2. To increase conversions from the Loyal Customers segment (14.0%), a special program can be implemented focusing on increasing transaction urgency, allowing them to move up to the Champion segment.
3. Similarly, for the Potential Loyalists segment (13.4%), a special program emphasizing increased transaction frequency can help them move up to the Champion segment.
4. Meanwhile, for the Hibernating segment (27.3%), a dedicated program can be designed to encourage them to start transacting again, even if not frequently, with the goal of advancing them to the Customers or even Potential Loyalists segment.
